# Smart Contract Demo using Solidity ⟠ Ξ

## This is a demo to be used by both students and beginners in the world of Blockchain and Smart Contracts and, can learn all the components that Crypto transactions contemplate.

### We're going to use a real Smart Contract developed with Solidity. Thanks to professor Hadelin de Ponteves to share in one of his sessions the original code with me, attending one of his sessions. 

### We need the next ecosystems to interact with the Smart Contract: 

- Remix - Ethereum IDE: https://remix.ethereum.org/
- Ganache: https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/
- MyEtherWallet.com: https://www.myetherwallet.com/
